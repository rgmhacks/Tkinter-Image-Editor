NOTE : To crop image you can manually enter the co-ordinates but a much simpler method is provided just double click on the respective position then click on the input box the value will be auto-filled but you have to follow the sequence : left -> top -> right -> bottom .
Same feature is provided for adding Text at a specific position.
